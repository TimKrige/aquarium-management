An attempt at an app to help me monitor and schedule my fertiliser additions to a freshwater fish tank

## Overview
An app to calculate optimised fertiliser (N,P,K) additions to a freshwater fish tank. Considers current and historic values, and recommends schedules for dosing ferts.

## Features
- Tracks water parameters
- Calculates optimal fertiliser dosage
- Allows for custom fertilisers
- Push notifications at a scheduled time to remind user to do maintenance
- Water Change calculator
- (future) CO2 monitoring and calc

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: Kivy
- Backend: Python
- Database: Simple JSON file
- Hardware integration: None

## Technical Highlights
- Ensures hobbist fish keepers can have accurate dosage calc at their fingertips
- Automatic recommendations to check water when a parameter is predicted out of range
- Basic graphing of parameters 

## Why This Project Matters
Beyond the aquarium use case, this demonstrates:
- Full-stack development capability
- [If applicable:] Time-series monitoring and alerting
- Building complete products, not just scripts

## Current Status
Prototyping, debugging
